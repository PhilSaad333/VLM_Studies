Project to understand multimodal AI



First step is to get some familiarity with the basics



Second is to build a "laboratory" with which I can study various phenomena unique to VLMs. For example, set up training for a VLM on a visual reasoning task.



Hopefully by then I'll have found some interesting questions to study and I can do some experiments.
